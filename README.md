# Azure RTOS SDK for Azure IoT

This repository contains SDK for Azure IoT services. SDK uses [ThreadX](https://github.com/azure-rtos/threadx) and [NetXDuo](https://github.com/azure-rtos/netxduo) to connect to Azure IoT.

## Documentation

Documentation for this library can be found here: [Link](docs/azure_rtos_iot_sdk_api.md)

## Key Features

:heavy_check_mark: feature available  :heavy_check_mark:* feature partially available (see Description for details)  :heavy_multiplication_x: feature planned but not supported

Feature | Azure RTOS SDK for Azure IoT services  | Description
---------|----------|---------------------
 [Send device-to-cloud message](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c) | :heavy_check_mark: | Send device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub with the option to add custom message properties. 
 [Receive cloud-to-device messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-c2d) | :heavy_check_mark: | Receive cloud-to-device messages and associated properties from IoT Hub.   
 [Device Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins) | :heavy_check_mark: | IoT Hub persists a device twin for each device that you connect to IoT Hub.  The device can perform operations like get twin document, subscribe to desired property updates.
 [Direct Methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods) | :heavy_check_mark: | IoT Hub gives you the ability to invoke direct methods on devices from the cloud.  
 [DPS - Device Provisioning Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/) | :heavy_check_mark: | This SDK supports connecting your device to the Device Provisioning Service via, for example, [individual enrollment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/concepts-service#enrollment) using an [X.509 leaf certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/concepts-security#leaf-certificate).  
 Protocol | MQTT | The Azure RTOS SDK for Azure IoT services supports only MQTT.
 [Plug and Play](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play) | Coming Soon | IoT Plug and Play Preview enables solution developers to integrate devices with their solutions without writing any embedded code.

# Security

Azure RTOS provides OEMs with components to secure communication and to create code and data isolation using underlying MCU/MPU hardware protection mechanisms. It is ultimately the responsibility of the device builder to ensure the device fully meets the evolving security requirements associated with its specific use case.
